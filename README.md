## Social Media Dashboard
My submitted solution for the "Social Media Dashboard" challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H) that I created to learn and practice React.
The website is made dynamic so that data can be fetched from a backend. In this example it is imported from a local JavaScript file.
